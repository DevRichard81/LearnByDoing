# LearnByDoing
**LearnByDoing** is a C# Learning Solution for Try-out stuff i am interesst in. 

# Non-Productive Code
All code in **LearnByDoing** is only to try and learning stuff, 
there is none or only a little afford for using it directly as it is.
* Can be unstable
* Incomplete
* Error handlings are missing
* Performance issues

# Thanks
If any like my tryouts and have idee's to improve stuff or also suggestion of what i miss, 
please let me know.
